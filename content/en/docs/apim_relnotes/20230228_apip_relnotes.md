## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

### New settings available for conditionally switching to single-column layout if the volume of endpoints are larger than the default

To improve performance when viewing APIs that have a large number of Swagger endpoints, we have added a configuration option in the Joomla! Administrator Interface (JAI) to allow you to define a maximum number of endpoints. When this maximum value is exceeded, the layout is automatically switched to **Single-column** as this view performs better with large volumes of endpoints. For more information, see [Customizing the API catalog and details views](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/customize_apicatalog_overview).

<!-- IAP-5663 breaking change -->

### New **AuthToMaster** policy is available, which removes warnings previously seen on import

Previously, importing the `AuthoToMasterDynamicOrg.xml` policy (which is shipped with the API Portal install package into Policy Studio to configure multiple API managers) generated several warnings. From this release, an upgraded **AuthToMaster** policy is shipped with the install and upgrade packages for API Portal, which fixes the issue that caused these warnings.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}To avail of this fix, you must replace the policy in Policy Studio with the updated **AuthToMaster** policy from this release.{{< /alert >}}

If the policy is not updated, the warnings will continue to be observed. For more information, see Connect API Portal to API Manager, [Import and configure the policies](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/connect_to_apimgr#import-and-configure-the-policies).

<!-- IAP-5873 breaking change -->

### The **Created By** field in Application catalog and details pages is changing in this release

A schema change has been made to add the `Creator Name` property inside the index in Elasticsearch.Â In order for this property to be populated, the index in Elasticsearch must first be reindexed.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Reindexing can be initiated automatically the next time the cron job is scheduled to run, but we recommend you to manually reindex immediately after updating your product to avoid any data discrepancies.{{< /alert >}}

For more information, see [Configure a schedule to push data to Elasticsearch](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/install_software_elastic#configure-a-schedule-to-push-data-to-Elasticsearch).

<!-- IAP-5946 breaking change -->

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

<!-- know issues below were added during February 23 release -->

### CSP is not applied in new UI scenario

The Content Security Policy (CSP) sets a policy that instructs the browser to only fetch resources from specified locations. The implementation details of the T4 PageBuilder component prevents the CSP to work, which might cause security concerns because there is no validation whether the browser is allowed to load the resource from a particular location. These are usually Javascript, CSS, and image resources.

Related Issue: IAP-5970

### Edit profile menu item cannot be edited

Users cannot edit the **Profile** menu item because, on save, it shows an error for a missing required field, the **Menu item type**. There is no specific type for this menu item, and it should not be edited.

Related Issue: IAP-5710

### Non-SSO users cannot login if the primary API Manager is configured to use SSO

When API Portal is configured to work with multiple API Managers and the *primary* API Manager is configured to use SSO, a new non-SSO user cannot be automatically created on the *secondary* API Manager on first login because the *primary* API Manager throws an error.

Related Issue: IAP-5869

### List of APIs is not correct on Application create page

This issue is observed only when Elasticsearch is enabled.

When a user that belongs to multiple organizations is creating an application, a drop-down list with the user's organizations is loaded. Selecting a different organization from the drop-down list changes the results in the list of APIs available for subscription for this application. When Elasticsearch is enabled, this list does not show the APIs from the chosen organization.

Related Issue: IAP-5670

### Application View and Edit pages are not accessible from API Details page

This issue is observed only when Elasticsearch is enabled.

When Elasticsearch is enabled, users cannot access the Application View and Edit pages from **API Details page > Application subscription** tab.

Related Issue: IAP-5964

### Organization Administrator is not able to share an application with other users

This issue is observed only when Elasticsearch is enabled.

An Organization Administrator is not able to share or unshare an application with other users when Elasticsearch is enabled.

Related Issue: IAP-5951

<!-- know issues below were preexistent to February 23 release -->

### Data Request feature is not available for SSO users without email in New UI page builder design

[Data Request](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/manage_privacy_personal_data#manage-data-requests) feature is not able to send request for SSO users without email only for New UI page builder design - T4 and Page Builder. The functionality is available, but the emails are automatically detected from Joomla login details, while for SSO users registered without emails this information is not available and the request generation is not able to proceed. For users upgrading from versions earlier than November 22 and still using T3 and Purity III, the stylization for API Portal Data Request functionality works as before.

Related Issue: IAP-5649

### Two-factor authentication is not available with Joomla 4.2.x in API Portal

Joomla 4.2.0 includes changes around two(multi)-factor authentications. However, this functionality is not yet available in API Portal. For more information, see [Joomla 4.2 release notes](https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5865-joomla-4-2-release.html).

Related issue: IAP-5504

### Custom properties permissions per role are not respected in some scenarios

Custom properties permissions per role will not be respected for the organization in the following scenarios:

* Permissions will not be respected for the organization the API is assigned to because respecting them will cause significant performance impact on the Try-it page. The custom properties permissions will follow the role of the user's primary organization.
* On creating an application, the App has no organization yet, so the custom properties permissions cannot be respected per role of the organization. They will follow the permissions for the role of the primary organization of the user.

Related issue: IAP-4474

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
